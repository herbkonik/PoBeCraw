# Building a Potato Bug Crawler 

I created this repository to show and share my work on an autonomous crawler (or rover) for collecting Colorado (potato) beetles in professional fields.

The project is still at a very early stage. A first very simple crawler, made only to solve the driving issues, runs and keeps track at a row. The next goal is to expand the software so that at the end of a bed is automatically turned and the next row is driven off.
